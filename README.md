# COSC_310_Group
General Repo for all group work 

NATE ---------------------------------------
I created a patient and symptom classes

A patient object will be created during conversation with the doctor
A Symptom object will be created during during conversation aswell

Symptoms will be added to the patient object, since they are all stored
in the end you can retrieve them and give a final diagnoses

My test.py class just gives examples how to use
