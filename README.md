Have a conversation with Doctor Notadoctar, a real PHD!

Hopefully you only have symptoms he is programed to deal with...

Get your expert diagnoses today!

Just run Chatbot.py, talk with the doctor, and let our state of the art symptom analysis
system recommend action!

## NATE WICKENHEISER ---------------------------------------
I created a patient and symptom classes

A patient object will be created during conversation with the doctor
A Symptom object will be created during during conversation aswell

Symptoms will be added to the patient object, since they are all stored
in the end you can retrieve them and give a final diagnoses

My test.py class just gives examples how to use
